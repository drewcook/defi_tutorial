# Defi Yield Farm

This is a decentralized yield farm built on the Ethereum blockchain.  The application allows users with Ethereum wallets to stake (deposit) mock DAI tokens in exchange for receiving rewards in the form of a custom ERC-20 "DApp Token", a custom token which represents this reward.  The investor can also withdraw their money at any time.
